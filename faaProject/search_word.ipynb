ABOUT 36 MINUTES AFTER THE ALTITUDE CHANGE TO 27,000 FEET, THE PILOT ADVISED ATC THAT HAD LOST CABIN PRESSURIZATION AND NEEDED AN IMMEDIATE DESCENT.  ABOUT 20 SECONDS LATER HE WAS CLEARED TO 25,000 FEET, THEN 15 SECONDS LATER TO 15,000 FEET.

AIRCRAFT ASCENDED TO APPROXIMATELY 250 FEET AGL, AT WHICH TIME THE PILOT COULD NOT CONTROL THE AIRCRAFT.  PILOT RELEASED FROM TOW AND USED RUDDER TO INITIATE A TURN TOWARD THE RUNWAY.  THE AIRCRAFT LANDED SHORT OF THE RUNWAY BY APPROXIAMTELY 20 FEET, GROUND LOOPED, AND STRUCK A BUSH.  THE FUSELAGE BROKE IN HALF AT A POINT AFT OF THE WINGS CAUSING THE TAIL SECTION TO SEPARATE FROM THE AIRCRAFT.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE GLIDER WAS STORED DISASSEMBLED ON A TRAILER.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE GLIDERPORT, HE PROCEEDED TO REASSEMBLE THE GLIDER.  HE ASSEMBLED THE WINGS FIRST, AND THEN CONNECTED THE AILERON PUSH RODS, WHICH ARE SECURED WITH BALL LOCK SAFETY PINS.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE THEN INSERTED THE PINS IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT AILERON PUSH ROD ATTACH FITTINGS AND MOVED THE CONTROL STICK TO CHECK THAT THE AILERONS WERE PROPERLY ENGAGED.  NO FURTHER DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED WITH THE REASSEMBLY OF THE GLIDER OR THE PREFLIGHT INSPECTION.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE  FIRST TAKEOFF WAS ABORTED DUE TO A LACK OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL, WHICH AT THE TIME HE ATTRIBUTED TO DUST DEVILS IN THE VICINITY. ON THE SECOND TAKEOFF AND INITIAL CLIMBOUT NO DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED UNTIL HE REACHED 100 FEET AGL, WHEN THE PILOT HAD DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING STRAIGHT AND LEVEL FLIGHT.  AS THE TOW PLANE MADE A TURN TO THE LEFT, THE GLIDER TURNED TO THE RIGHT.  THE PILOT RELEASED THE GLIDER FROM THE TOW PLANE AND APPLIED FULL LEFT RUDDER AND LEFT AILERON TO STOP THE ROLL.  THE PILOT STATED THAT THE GLIDER MAINTAINED A 10-DEGREE RIGHT WING DOWN CONFIGURATION.  UPON TOUCHDOWN THE RIGHT WING COLLIDED WITH A BRUSH AND THE GLIDER GROUND LOOPED.

THE PUSH ROD WOULD HAVE BEEN LYING IN THE FITTING, BUT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENGAGED.

THE FORCED LANDING WAS PRECIPITATED BY A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE IN CRUISE. THE AIRCRAFT WAS OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE PILOT UNDER  CFR PART 91 OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION REGULATIONS. THE AIRCRAFT INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE AND THE VEHICLE MINOR DAMAGE. THE PRIVATE PILOT, THE SOLE OCUPANT, WAS NOT INJURED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES TO PERSONS ON THE GROUND. THE PERSONAL FLIGHT ORIGINATED AT 0900 AS A ROUND ROBIN CROSS-COUNTRY FROM CHINO, CALIFORNIA, TO THERMAL, AND WAS RETURNING TO CHINO WHEN THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE SAFETY BOARD ON APRIL 26, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO CHINO FROM THERMAL WHEN THE ENGINE SMOOTHLY QUIT. HE SWITCHED FUEL TANKS, TURNED ON THE ELECTRIC BOOST PUMP AND ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN A RESTART, WITHOUT SUCCESS. AS THE AIRCRAFT DESCENDED, HE SELECTED A CLEAR AREA ON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY FOR A LANDING. NEARING TOUCHDOWN, HE HAD TO MANEUVER TO AVOID A HIGHWAY SIGN AND THE RIGHT WING CONTACTED THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK. THE PILOT FURTHER REPORTED THAT AS THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN, THE ENGINE RESTARTED. DURING THE INTERVIEW, THE PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN IN A LOCAL PAINT SHOP FOR THE PAST 60 DAYS FOR REPAINTING. THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT AFTER THE AIRCRAFT WAS PICKED UP. WHEN HE DEPARTED FROM CHINO ON THE OUTBOUND LEG, THE PILOT USED THE RIGHT FUEL TANK BECAUSE THE FUEL INDICATORS SHOWED IT TO BE THE FULLEST TANK. THE 20-MINUTE FLIGHT TO THERMAL WAS UNEVENTLFUL AND THE PILOT SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AFTER LANDING. THE PILOT WAS ON THE GROUND 10 MINUTES, THEN RESTARTED THE AIRCRAFT FOR THE RETURN FLIGHT TO CHINO. THE ENGINE START AND FLIGHT WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON THE LEFT FUEL TANK BECAUSE THE FUEL GAGE SHOWED IT TO BE 3 FULL WHILE THE RIGHT INDICATED 1/2 TANK. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE PERFORMED A THOROUGH ENGINE RUN-UP BEFORE TAKEOFF FROM THERMAL AND THAT THE FLIGHT TO THE POINT OF POWER LOSS WAS UNEVENTFUL. THE AIRCRAFT WAS RECOVERED WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF DISASSEMBLY OR DISTURBANCE TO ANY AIRCRAFT SYSTEM. A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTOR FROM THE RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA, FLIGHT STANDARDS DISTRICT OFFICE EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT AT THE RECOVERY FACILITY. THE FUEL TANKS AND LINES WERE INTACT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF LEAKAGE. ONE PINT OF FUEL WAS DRAINED FROM THE LEFT TANK WHILE THE RIGHT TANK CONTAINED 15 GALLONS. THE FUEL VENT LINES FOR THE LEFT TANK WERE CLEAR. THE REAR VENT LINES FOR THE RIGHT TANK WERE ALSO UNOBSTRUCTED. THE FORWARD VENT LINE FOR THE NIGHT TANK WAS FOUND PLUGGED WITH INSECT DEBRIS AND DIRT. FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE FORWARD RIGHT TANK LINE REVEALED THAT IT WAS DISCONNECTED AT THE B-NUT, WHICH CONNECTS THE LINE TO A CHECK VALVE AND OPEN TO ATMOSPHERE INSIDE THE WING. THE FUEL INDICATING SYSTEM WAS EXAMINED BY POWERING UP THE AIRCRAFT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. THE RIGHT TANK SENDING UNIT AND COCKPIT GAGE WAS FOUND TO BE ACCURATE.
